                        It is generally recommended to book a hotel at least two weeks in advance to secure your
                        preferred room type and price. However, during peak travel seasons or for popular destinations,
                        it's best to book as early as possible to avoid disappointment.

                        There are several ways to find deals on hotel bookings, such as subscribing to hotel
                        newsletters, using price comparison websites, checking for promotions on social media, and
                        booking directly with the hotel to get loyalty discounts or perks.

                        It depends on the hotel's cancellation policy, which can vary depending on the rate you booked
                        and the hotel's individual policies. Generally, you may be able to cancel or modify your
                        reservation up to a certain time before your arrival date, but some hotels may charge a fee for
                        changes or cancellations.

                        It depends on your preference and budget. If you plan to eat breakfast outside of the hotel, it
                        may be more cost-effective to book a room without breakfast included. However, if you prefer the
                        convenience of having breakfast at the hotel, it may be worth booking a room with breakfast
                        included. </p>

                        You can make a request for a specific room type or location during the booking process, but it's
                        not guaranteed. To increase your chances of getting your preferred room, it's best to book as
                        early as possible and follow up with the hotel directly to confirm your request closer to your
                        arrival date. </p>
